Lists

Lists are another type of sequence that is very similar to 'Tuples'
Any procedure or operator we use with Tuples will work on a list

The biggest difference between lists and Tuples is 'Lists' are Mutable
NOTES
1. A Tuple can be concattenated another Tuple
2. You can concatenate a Tuple to a list
3. You can not concatenate a list to a Tuple
"""

# A list can be created and populated using the following syntax
# Example 1
# list_name = ["item1", "item2", "item3", "item4"]
#             # index 0, index 1, index 2, index 3


# Example 2
len(list_name) # Returns 4 if using the example above

# Slicing a list works the same list_name[:] !End point is exclusive
